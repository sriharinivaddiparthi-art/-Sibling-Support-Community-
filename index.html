        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            This website was created to bring together siblings of neurodivergent individuals.
            Growing up in this role can feel overwhelming, isolating, and even scary when thinking about the future.
            Here, you are not alone.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a space to share experiences, read others’ stories, and support one another.
            Your voice matters.
