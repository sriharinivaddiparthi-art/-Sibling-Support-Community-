    <p>Here are some stories from siblings who have shared their experiences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"I often feel overwhelmed caring for my sibling, but reading others' stories makes me feel less alone."</li>
        <li>"I never realized so many siblings have the same fears about the future."</li>
